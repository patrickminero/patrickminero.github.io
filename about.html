        <h3>My Programming Journey</h3>
        <p>Back in the late 2000s, I studied Law in college then I decided to move to the California Bay Area where I would spend the next 11 years of my life.</p>
        <p>After burning my self out in food-service management, working two jobs, I felt the need for a change in my lifestyle and wanted to improve my career options and hopefully have a better life quality.</p>
        <p>After weeks of research, I set up a plan, worked extra hours, saved as much money as I could, and embarked on an open-ended trip around 4 continents and 25 countries volunteering in small family farms and businesses.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Eighteen months later and back in the routine, I moved to Barcelona, Spain, and while waiting to get my paperwork through local authorities, I started to learn web development.</p>
        <p>I started my research and out of the thousands of options, I came across Codecademy. I decided to try out their “How to build websites with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages” skill path since it was free and wanted to make sure I liked computer programming as a career choice.</p>
        <p>A few weeks later I was hooked, it was easier than what I expected it to be, very clear and straight forward but captivating enough to spark my curiosity.</p>

        </div>
        <p>When I finished the skill path I decided to upgrade to Codecademy PRO to learn more complex skills, I also researched popular coding tools and resources to start creating small projects and web pages.</p>
        <p>After a few months of practice I felt like Codecademy, online resources and tutorials were not enough, I wanted real job experiences so I enrolled at Le Wagon were I learned technical and personals skills that developers use everyday.</p>
